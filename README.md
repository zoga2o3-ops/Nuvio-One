## What is it

Nuvio + IPTV + 1Tube is a personal fork that puts three things in one TV app:

1. **[Nuvio](https://github.com/NuvioMedia/NuvioTV)**: the home screen, addons, Trakt and Simkl, your Nuvio account and its settings, and Nuvio's player.
2. **IPTV**: a TiviMate-style Live TV guide, a Sports hub, catch-up, recordings and On Demand, from [NuvioPlusIPTV](https://github.com/homelessbrian/NuvioPlusIPTV) by homelessbrian.
3. **1Tube**: a YouTube section of its own in the side menu, built into the app and played in Nuvio's own player. It's not a launcher and not a web view.

You sign in with your usual Nuvio account and everything you set up there carries over: TMDB, Trakt, Simkl, MDBList, Premiumize, ratings, trailers, intro skip, avatars and Drive backup. The app has its own package name, so it installs next to the official Nuvio and next to NuvioPlusIPTV without replacing either one.

---

## 1Tube: YouTube, built in

YouTube has its own page in the side menu. **Nothing from YouTube shows up on Nuvio's Home or in Continue Watching.** Your YouTube watching stays on the YouTube page.

### Browsing
- **Tabs:** Home, Subscriptions, History, Playlists, Live, Music, Gaming, News, Sports, Shorts and Channels. Turn any tab on or off and put them in any order under **Settings → YouTube**.
- **Remember the last tab:** open on the tab you were on, or always start on Home.
- **Search** with suggestions as you type, plus your search history.
- **Channel pages and playlists,** with endless scrolling in the feeds.
- **Clear messages** when something can't load or a video can't play, instead of a blank screen.

### Accounts
- **Sign in with a QR code:** scan it with your phone and approve. No typing on the TV.
- **Several accounts and channel profiles:** the account button at the top left of the page switches between them.
- **Watch progress goes back to YouTube,** so History and the "resume" bar match what you see on other devices.

### Playing
- **Nuvio's own player,** so the controls, subtitles and remote behave the way they do for everything else in the app. The Watch Party and Sources buttons are hidden for YouTube, where they make no sense.
- **Quality picker** (up to 4K) and a **video format choice** (for example AV1, VP9 or H.264), with a remembered default for each.
- **Fast start:** the next video is looked up ahead of time, and stream links are refreshed if they have gone stale.
- **Chapters,** shown on the seek bar and skippable from the player.
- **Loop** a video.
- **Autoplay** with an **up-next card** in the corner showing the next video's thumbnail and title.
- **Playback speed is remembered** between videos.
- **Captions** through the player's usual subtitle menu.
- **Live streams** play too, with **live chat** as an overlay.

### The player panel
Open the YouTube button in the player for:
- **Like and dislike,** as buttons of their own.
- **Subscribe,** and a **Channel** button that shows the channel's profile picture and opens the channel.
- **Save to a playlist.**
- **Comments:** sort by **Top** or **Newest**, open replies, and scroll with the remote without losing your place.
- **Hide this channel.**

### Skipping and cleaning up
- **SponsorBlock:** skip sponsors, intros, outros, self-promotion and more automatically, or have the app **ask first** with a skip card. Choose what to skip under **Settings → YouTube**.
- **DeArrow:** community-written titles and real thumbnails in place of clickbait. Each part can be turned on or off.
- **No ads** in playback.
- **Feed filters:** hide Shorts, watched videos and upcoming premieres.
- **Hidden words and channels:** anything matching a word or phrase, or coming from a channel you hide, is removed from the feeds.

### How it works
YouTube is handled by **MediaServiceCore**, the engine behind SmartTube, vendored in `mediaservicecore/`. The app plays through a small loopback server so Nuvio's ExoPlayer gets a proper DASH manifest. The 1Tube code lives in `app/src/main/java/com/nuvio/tv/youtube/`.

## Live TV, Sports and On Demand (from Nuvio + IPTV)

All of this comes from NuvioPlusIPTV and works as it does there. Here is what you get.

### Live TV
- **TiviMate-style guide** with channels down the side, a timeline across and a "now" line, in four sizes. Browse by group, by playlist or by channel name.
- **Overlay mode:** press Left while watching for a see-through guide with the group's channels and the show details, and Right for a channel's full schedule.
- **Your sources:** several M3U playlists and XMLTV guides merged into one, and Xtream Codes logins with choices for TV, movies and series, stream format and account details.
- **Smart guide matching,** with **Assign EPG** to fix any single channel and time-shift settings for providers that are off.
- **Catch-up:** watch past shows with a seek bar, restart what's on now and carry on into the next show.
- **Pause and rewind live TV,** zap with Up and Down or by number, jump to the last channel, and set a sleep timer.
- **Channel management:** hide, reorder, rename, renumber and copy channels and groups, make your own groups, and keep favorites and recently watched lists.
- **Channel name cleanup** to strip tags like "USA:", "HD" and "24/7".
- **Remembered audio track** for each channel, frame-rate matching, audio passthrough, auto-reconnect and recovery from stuck streams.
- **Parental PIN** for any group or category. Adult content locks by itself.

### Sports hub
- **My Sports:** a big card for your next games, rows for Live and Upcoming, and a row for every team, country, league or name you follow.
- **All Events** with day tabs from a week back to a week ahead.
- **Tables** for football, US sports and racing, with form, place changes and playoff lines.
- **160+ leagues and competitions** across football, US sports, rugby, racing, golf, tennis, fighting and more.
- **Finds your channels:** every channel in your own playlists that is showing a game, marked **SHOWING IT** or **MAYBE**, with **Fix Channel** to remember your choice.
- **Watch beside the page** in a video window, **watch from the start** on catch-up channels, and see game pages with scores, stats and line-ups.
- **Reminders,** automatic switching a minute before kick-off, and recording a game.
- **Hide Scores** for spoiler-free browsing, and scoring alerts when your team scores.

### Recordings
- Record a show or a whole series from the guide, to the device or a USB drive.
- Padding before and after, low-space rules, and recordings that carry on with the app closed or the box in standby.
- Watch a recording while it is still recording.

### On Demand
- Movies and series from your Xtream providers, with categories, recently added, search and sorting.
- Titles open on Nuvio's normal details page with your own addon artwork, and appear in Nuvio's stream list.

### Part of Nuvio, not bolted on
- Live TV, On Demand, Sports, Recordings and YouTube sit in Nuvio's side menu, with their settings inside Nuvio's own Settings.
- Pick a **start page,** a **Home row** of favorite channels, and have live channels show up in Nuvio's search.
- **Google Drive sync** of your Live TV and Sports setup.

3. Install it with a file manager or an app like Downloader, and allow installs from unknown sources when asked.

It needs **Android 7.0 or newer** (Fire OS 6 or later).

## Reporting bugs and asking for features

Please look through the [existing issues](https://github.com/zoga2o3-ops/NuvioPlusIPTV-1T/issues) first, then [open a new one](https://github.com/zoga2o3-ops/NuvioPlusIPTV-1T/issues/new). Say which device you use, what you did and what happened. For YouTube problems, mention the video's title or link.

If the app crashes, scan the QR code on the crash screen and paste the text into your report. If a playlist, guide or catch-up doesn't load, include **Settings → Live TV → Help → Start-Up Report** (usernames and passwords are hidden in it).

Problems that also happen in the official Nuvio app belong with [Nuvio](https://github.com/NuvioMedia/NuvioTV/issues).

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Does it come with any channels, movies or videos?</b></summary>

No. It plays what you add yourself: your own playlists, guides, Xtream logins, addons and debrid services, plus YouTube, which anyone can watch.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Will it replace my Nuvio or Nuvio + IPTV app?</b></summary>

No. It has its own package name and installs alongside both.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does YouTube show up on Home or in Continue Watching?</b></summary>

No. YouTube watching stays on the YouTube page and in your YouTube History.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>A YouTube video won't play.</b></summary>

The app shows the reason on screen (age restriction, region, private video and so on). If a stream link has gone stale, back out and open the video again. If it keeps happening, open an issue with the video link.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Where do ads go?</b></summary>

YouTube's ads aren't requested by the player. Sponsor segments inside videos are handled by SponsorBlock, which you can set to skip or to ask first.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What does Google Drive sync store, and where?</b></summary>

Your Live TV and Sports setup, in a private app folder in your own Google Drive that only this app can see.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Where do sports scores come from?</b></summary>

ESPN's public feed, TheSportsDB and sporting-events.org. Sports they don't cover are found in your own TV guide.
</details>
